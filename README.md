# CMPT276 - Assignment 2 


For this assignment, I created a student database using a controller, which includes @GetMapping and @PostMapping, these controller will help me to retrieve my HTML files. 

For the main features of my webpage, I used bootstrap to add a navigation bar to switch between the table database, displaying the data, and adding new user to the database. 

For the table data page, I used thymeleaf to list all of my student's data and its attributes. In order to make the data more presentable, I used <table> to create a table of informations and style the table using CSS. 
  
For the data display page, I used the design similar to an ID Card with rectangles. I displayed an image of a user on the left with two buttons below it to edit/update the data or delete the user from the database. For the student's information, I set the name of the student to be the largest size to make it stand out. I positioned the email to be beside the name and the major right under the name. Since this is a student related data display; name, email, and major are the most important attributes. For the additional information such as GPA, Graduation Year, nationality, weight, hair color, and height, I divide them into two columns under the major attribute to make it more readable and neat. 
  
For the adding new student and editing, I used the instructor's format and updated some features according to my liking. I changed the submit color button to align with my display color, I added the image of a user besides the name to make it more like "Registering a new student to the database", and I added a background color of the box to create a border to the form of adding and editing student's information. All of these features are using Bootstrap and CSS combined together.
